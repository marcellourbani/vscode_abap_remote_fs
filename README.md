# ABAP remote filesystem for visual studio code (beta)

Turns Visual studio code into an IDE for ABAP development, operating directly on your SAP server.

Is less capable and more buggy than Eclipse with ADT, but also more responsive, and has a couple of extra features not found in Eclipse, like listing changed sources by transport and normalizing changes in diff views

## Getting started

The easiest way is to first create a connection with an ABAP server by running command

> AbapFs Create connection

and follow the instructions, then run command

> AbapFs Connect to an ABAP system

to connect to it. Your abap code will appear in the file tree on the left.

You can also look up ABAP objects by name with command

> AbapFs Search for object

**Unless your system is very modern (7.51 or later I think), write support will require you to install [this plugin](https://github.com/marcellourbani/abapfs_extensions)** in your dev server to enable. Browsing works even without it

- source control
- debugging
- view short dumps
- integrated with [abapGit](https://github.com/larshp/abapGit) (now using the scm view)

## setup

Check the system requirements on the [wiki](https://github.com/marcellourbani/vscode_abap_remote_fs/wiki) and follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/marcellourbani/vscode_abap_remote_fs/wiki/installation)

You will end up with one or more server connections like this in your vs code configuration:

```json
{
  "abapfs.remote": {
    "NPL": {
      "url": "https://vhcalnplci:8000",
      "username": "developer",
      "password": "secret",
      "client": "001", // client is required for SAPGUI integration. Might need more
      "language": "EN",
      "allowSelfSigned": true
    }
  }
}
```
